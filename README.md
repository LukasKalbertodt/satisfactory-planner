## Icons

The 256px versions were extracted from the game via FModel. 
They were reencoded as avif via `avifenc -s 0 -q 70`.

## License

TODO

Some parts of this repository are not licensed as specified above, since I did not create them.
The game data in `src/gamedata/{items,recipes}.ts` is derived from [the Satisfactory Wiki](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg) (which is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA). 
The wiki got the data from the game, which is not officially freely licensed (also see [this Q&A](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/post/65e5367dcd33105bd53f931f)).
Icons are also taken from the game.
The general assumption is that this usage of the data is considered fair use.
Coffee Stain seems to welcome these community projects and is not known to take down projects for using this kind of game data.
